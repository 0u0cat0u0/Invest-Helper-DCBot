This Discord Bot provides users with real-time access to the current prices of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex pairs. Here's how it works and how we can expand it:

Price Lookup: Users can query the bot for the current price of a specific stock, cryptocurrency, or forex pair. The bot retrieves this information from various financial APIs or data sources.

Arbitrage Calculator: Users can input details about a particular asset available on two different exchanges. The bot then calculates whether there's an arbitrage opportunity between the two exchanges and how much profit the user could potentially make. It considers factors like exchange fees, transfer fees, and price differences.

Portfolio Tracking: Users can record their purchases of stocks, cryptocurrencies, or forex pairs. The bot allows users to input details such as the asset's name, purchase price, quantity, and timestamp. It then stores this information and provides users with summaries of their portfolios, including current values and gains/losses.

Interactive Commands: The bot provides an interactive interface for users to input commands and retrieve information. It offers helpful prompts and suggestions to guide users through various functionalities.
